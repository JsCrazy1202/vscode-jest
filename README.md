 ## The Aim

A comprehensive experience when using [Faceook's Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) within a project. 

* Useful IDE based Feedback
* Session based test watching

## Features

* Starts Jest automatically when you're in a project with it installed.
* (WIP) Show individual fail / passes inline.
* Show the overall pass/fail for the suite.
* (WIP) Show fails inside the problem inspector.

## Current Issues

* Don't have an way to do show pass/fail for specific tests

This shows itself in the red/green on an issue, and on the problem inspector. They depend on the next release of Jest. 

## Future Ideas

* Show message for the fail inline in the editor?
