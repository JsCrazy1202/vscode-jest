# vscode-jest

This is a WIP, this README represents what I want, not what it is yet. 

## The Aim

A comprehensive experience when using Jest with a project. 

* Useful Feedback
* Session based test watching

### Feedback

* Inline information
 * Test files should ideally have related tests highlighted
 * Related files should have a pass/fail indicator

* Could potentially use the @code fail/warning system for fails or it can add it's own information on green/red, clicking should bring them up
* Should be able to see all info from the run inside an output panel, incase you want to work and get insta-feedback inline

### Session based watching

* Opening a project with Jest should start to run the tests by default, you should be able to opt out
* Should be able to declare what the command to run jest should look like
* Closing a project, should close the tests
